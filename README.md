# Data-Driven-Hotel-Analysis

## Overview
At Techionista Academy, our team of five embarked on a business case project aimed at gaining practical experience in preparation for careers as data engineers. This particular case, closely tied to the Microsoft PL300 exam, centered around the analysis of hotel reviews from the fictional website Techionista Holidays spanning the years 2015 to 2017. Our focus was on various aspects of the reviewers and hotels, including nationalities, traveler types, and hotel locations. This repository serves as a comprehensive repository of our work, analyzing a dataset consisting of a staggering 515,000 records pertaining to holiday trends.

Techionista Holidays' managers expressed a strong desire to gain deeper insights into the different types of travelers and their feedback. These valuable insights can play a pivotal role in enhancing Techionista's Holidays website and their capacity to cater to the evolving needs of their users.

## Objective
Our primary objective was to craft an all-encompassing interactive dashboard that offers valuable insights into different categories of travelers and their feedback. These insights would, in turn, be harnessed to enhance the Techionista Holidays website, ensuring a more tailored and effective user experience. The key features of our project include:

## Features

1. **Interactive Dashboard:** Our dashboard empowers users with a wide range of filtering options, allowing them to explore data by country, city, hotel, date, trip type, traveler category, and nationality.
2. **Visualizations:** We have leveraged various visualization techniques, including maps, word clouds, charts, and more, to deliver a compelling and informative experience for users.
3. **Pages:**

Our role in this endeavor was to extract meaningful information from travelers' reviews about their experiences. This information aimed to provide valuable insights that can aid in enhancing the hotel's overall performance and customer satisfaction.
